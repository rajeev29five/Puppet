# Puppet

A script using python and opencv that allows user to control mouse pointer with the help of color markers. These color markers are 
detected using internal or external webcam of the system. Pixel positions of the color markers in the frames are used to move 
cursor from one point to another on the screen. Mouse movements and events such as mouse clicks, and hold and drag can be achieved 
using different color markers and their combinations.
